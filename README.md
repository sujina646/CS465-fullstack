CS-465 Full stack Development with MEAN

            Travlr Getaways – Full Stack MEAN Application
Working on the Travlr Getaways project was honestly one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had so far in this course. I had the chance to explore and combine different frontend development approaches, and it really opened my eyes to how each method has its own strengths depending on the user’s needs. For the customer-facing website, I decided to use Express HTML along with Handlebars templates. I made this choice because I wanted the initial load time to be as fast as possible and also make sure that search engines could easily read the content—super important for visibility and SEO. The server-side rendering approach worked beautifully for this part of the project.
For the admin side of the application, though, I wanted a different experience, something more interactive and dynamic. So I went with an Angular single-page application (SPA). This made the portal feel way more responsive, like using a native desktop app. Admins could navigate between views, manage trip packages, and update information without constantly refreshing the whole page. It felt modern and efficient, which is exactly what I was going for. Honestly, the contrast between these two frontend approaches gave me a clearer understanding of how user experience can be shaped by tech choices.
What I found super interesting was how both approaches used JavaScript but in totally different ways. With Express HTML and Handlebars, JavaScript was mostly there for little enhancements to things like dropdowns, validation, or other small behaviors. Angular, on the other hand, is built on TypeScript and takes a full-blown component-based architecture approach. That meant I could break down complex UI elements into smaller, manageable pieces that I could reuse and maintain more easily. It took a bit of getting used to at first, but once I got the hang of it, it really improved my workflow.
On the backend side, I chose MongoDB, and I can confidently say it was the right decision for this kind of project. The structure of travel packages isn’t always predictable; some have flights, some don’t; some include activities, others don’t. MongoDB’s document-oriented and schema-less design gave me the flexibility I needed to work with all of these variations without struggling with strict table relationships like in SQL databases. It saved me so much time and effort when adjusting to new requirements that popped up during development.
Another thing I appreciated about MongoDB was how well it handled scaling and large volumes of data. While I didn’t work with millions of users in this project, knowing that MongoDB could handle it down the line was reassuring. It also played really nicely with JavaScript-based frameworks since it stores data in a JSON-like format, which made the full-stack development process more seamless. It almost felt like MongoDB, Express, and Angular were all speaking the same language.
Speaking of JSON, I didn’t fully realize just how central it is to modern web development until I worked on this project. JSON became the bridge that tied everything together whether it was transferring data from the frontend to the backend, saving it to the database, or sending it back to the user. It’s funny because JSON looks like JavaScript, but it’s just a universal data format. And that made it the perfect fit for our MEAN stack application.
I found it especially satisfying when I set up the flow for creating and displaying new trips. A user could submit a form on the Angular side, and behind the scenes, the app would send a JSON payload to the Express API. The backend would then validate and store that data in MongoDB, and later, another API call would return it as JSON for the UI to render. It felt like this perfect cycle, and once everything clicked into place, it was just such a proud moment.
One of the improvements I made that I’m really happy about was moving away from hard-coded static trip data. In the early stages, I just had some sample JSON files lying around, but that wasn’t realistic for a dynamic app. So I refactored the app to pull trip data directly from MongoDB. That way, whenever I added or edited a trip, it showed up instantly without having to touch the codebase. It made the whole project feel more like a real, production-ready application.
I also started thinking more like a frontend engineer by building reusable components in Angular. One example is the trip-card component I created. This one piece of UI could be used across different pages to display trip details, and I could pass in different data as needed. It kept things consistent, easier to maintain, and much quicker to develop. Instead of rewriting the same markup over and over, I just reused the component wherever it made sense.
Security became a bigger focus as I added more functionality. I implemented JWT-based authentication to protect the API and make sure only authorized users (like admins) could access sensitive routes. This meant I had to test things like token expiration, role-based access, and ensuring users couldn’t do things they weren’t supposed to. It was challenging, but really satisfying once it was working smoothly. Postman became my best friend during this phase. I used it to send all kinds of requests and check how the server responded.
Testing the different endpoints wasn’t just about making sure the API worked, it was also about handling bad data gracefully. I created tests for edge cases like missing fields, invalid types, and trying to access data without proper authorization. I also ran manual tests in the UI to make sure error messages displayed correctly and that nothing broke when things didn’t go as planned. This really gave me a better appreciation for how important thorough testing is in full-stack development.
Looking back, this course has been a huge turning point for me. I feel like I’ve grown from someone who just dabbled in bits and pieces of web dev to someone who can actually build a full-stack application from the ground up. I now understand how the frontend, backend, and database all work together, and I’m comfortable using tools like Angular, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I’ve also learned how to think critically about architecture decisions and can confidently explain the “why” behind my choices. All of this has brought me one big step closer to my goal of becoming a skilled, job-ready full stack developer.
